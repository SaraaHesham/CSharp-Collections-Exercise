# 🛒 CSharp-Collections–Project  

A **console-based shopping cart application** built in **C#** to explore **collections** (`List`, `Dictionary`, `Stack`, `Tuple`, `IEnumerable`). The project demonstrates key collection operations with features like **adding, removing, checking out, and undoing actions**. 🚀

## 📌 Project Description  

This project is a **console-based shopping cart system** designed as a practical exercise in using **C# collections**. It allows users to **browse items, add them to a cart, remove items, view their cart, checkout, and undo their last action**.  

### **🛠️ Key Concepts Covered:**  
✔ **List, Dictionary, Stack, Tuple, and IEnumerable** usage in real-world scenarios.  
✔ **Undo feature implementation** using a stack.  
✔ **Efficient data retrieval** with dictionaries and tuples.  
✔ **Console-based user interaction and input handling.**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Collections (List, Dictionary, Stack, Tuple, IEnumerable)**

## 📝 Code Highlights
- **List<string> CartItems** → Stores the items added to the cart.
- **Dictionary<string, double> ItemPrices** → Stores available items with their prices.
- **Stack<string> Actions** → Keeps track of actions for the undo feature.
- **Tuple<string, double>** → Used to store and retrieve item prices efficiently.
- **IEnumerable<Tuple<string, double>>** → Facilitates iteration over cart items and their prices.
